# member only authentication without using Devise

I decided to learn `session` and `authentication` first to understand more in detail these 2 fundamental concepts in ruby ​​on rails.

## Tasks

1. The task here is to build clubhouse where members cannot post as long as they are not logged in
2. If they don't have account yet the should sign up in the application
3. People who are not logged in can see all members post, if they click on post they will be redirected in sign in / sign up page.

## To achieve these tasks, I follow [this blog](https://stevepolito.design/blog/rails-authentication-from-scratch/) where all is well explained
